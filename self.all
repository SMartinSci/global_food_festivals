   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mHome to some of Australiaâ€™s most prominent wine-growing regions, wide swaths of the Outback and such biodiverse destinations as Kangaroo Island and the Limestone Coast, it would feasibly take months (or even years) to explore the reaches of South Australiaâ€˜s gastronomy and viticultureâ€”not to mention its many scenic regions.[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mThankfully, Tasting Australia condenses many of the stateâ€™s food and wine highlights into a robust 10-day program of more than 140 eventsâ€”farm tours, wine, beer,Â and spirits tastings and masterclasses, leisurely chef-driven lunches and dinners included. Festival highlights include the Glasshouse Kitchen in the capital city of Adelaide, where lauded Australian chefs and international culinary stars team up for some memorable meals, and Tasting Australia Airlines, which transports visitors to some of the stateâ€™s more remote culinary destinations on all-inclusive full-day tours.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mAt its inaugural event in May, the Venice Food & Wine FestivalÂ lined up American and Italian culinary luminaries with more than a few Michelin stars (and James Beard awards) for its four-day showcase at the JW Marriott Venice Resort & Spa, which is located on its own private island in Venice, the Isola delle Rose. On the agenda: chef-led demos, cooking academies, wine tastings, cocktail workshops and a few fabulous dinners, of course. As a bonus, the opening party and concert finale are complimentary to all guests staying at the resort over the weekend.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mThe roster of celebrity chefs who head for Las Vegas every May for Vegas Uncorkâ€™dâ€”Sin Cityâ€™s extravagant, four-day epicurean feast and drink festâ€”is impressive, to say the least. Gordon Ramsay, Bobby Flay, Giada De Laurentiis, Masaharu Morimoto and Nobu Matsuhisa are all Vegas Uncorkâ€™d regulars and each edition brings a host of new and notable events and culinary all-star talent, too.[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mThe festivalâ€™s busy agenda features dine-around showcases, master series with star chefs, brunches, poolside parties and more, but the weekendâ€™s signature event is The Grand Tasting at Caesars Palace, which can accommodate upwards of 2,500 revelers. More than 50 chef-helmed stationsâ€”and twice as many wine and cocktail stopsâ€”ensures that no attendee will depart this annual desert bacchanal either hungry or thirsty.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,
